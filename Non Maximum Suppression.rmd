This is a class of algorithms to select one entity out of many overlapping entities. The criteria commonly used to achieve this are some forms of probabilites and overlap measures (such as IoU - Intersection Over Union).

## Intersection Over Union (IoU)

The idead of IoU is from [Jaccard Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). The Jaccard Index is defined as $J(A, B) = \frac{|A |}{}$
